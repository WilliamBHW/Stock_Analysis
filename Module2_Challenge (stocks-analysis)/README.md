# Green Energy Stock Analysis

## Overview
This project is aimed to analyze how much daily volumes each stock earned in toal and their growth in the selected year. Througout the use of VBA, the project will present how refactoring will reduce run time and preserve accuracy of the result.

## Results
Both macros used for loops in order to analyze the total daily volume of each stock and their growth in percentages. The original macro uses nested for loops to perform calculation and insertion of corresponding data. The refactored macro uses array to store values calculated and reads data from stores arrays to fill the cells.
