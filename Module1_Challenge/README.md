# Analysis of Outcomes' Relation to Campaign's Launch Date and Funding Goal

## Overview of Project
After Louiseâ€™s play came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. This project has shown statistics on how campaigns outcomes in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals throughout charts and graphs.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visualize how theater campaigns being held/canceled in a timely manner. On the other hand, the percentages of campagins that reached each goal is another information that is going to be visualized throughout this project.

## Analysis and Challenges

#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis of outcomes based on lunch date consist of pivot table and a line chart where theater as the main filter for parent category. Count of outcomesbeing y-axis with month of the year being the x-axis. Colors are used to differenciate each category of outcomes. This graph presents the trend of outcomes by month.

#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis of outcomes based on goals consist of datasets and a line chart where "plays" being the filter of subcategory. Goals splitted into different ranges from "less than 1000" to "greater than 50000" as the x-axis, percentages of each outcome as y-axis. Color used to differenciate each type of outcomes. The graph presented the trend of outcomes by goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Possible challenges may be to confirm that the original data is not filterted before any actions require it to be. Filtering on original data will make a mess on further reports such as functions that require additional filter on specific category. Formatting on the other hand, would be a simple but impermative mistake often made when entering data. Cell elements need to be formatted with care.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
